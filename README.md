**Is a stopwatch faster than a timer?**
+ These two different methods of timing will nearly always yield different times. Although it is generally acknowledged by professionals that hand measured times are always “faster” than actual or electronic times, there have been few disciplined studies conducted to objectively quantify this difference.

**What is the use of timer?**
+ Timers are used to measure specific time intervals. But in electrical engineering terms, timers are also referred to as counters often. The timer is a component which is extensively used in different embedded systems. They are used to keep a record of time for different events occurring in the embedded systems
